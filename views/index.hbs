            At EECScon, attendees have the unique opportunity of interacting with students presenting and discussing their passions. This engaging environment allows companies to successfully recruit MIT’s best and brightest students through a “reverse” career fair, and faculty to learn about some of the diverse research done at MIT.

        FAQ
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-question ">
      When will abstract submission open?
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-answer ">
      Submissions for EECScon 2017 have opened - sign up above to submit an abstract! Abstracts will be accepted until February 21, 2017.
    </div>

    <div class = "faq-question">
            What are the requirements?
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-answer ">
      We suggest at least one term of research experience, such as part-time work in the fall or full-time research over IAP. This usually provides enough depth of research to allow you to make a good poster or oral presentation. Please note that your research may be incomplete by the abstract deadline (February 21), but it must be ready a few weeks before the conference (early April).
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-question ">
      Am I eligible?
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-answer ">
       Any undergraduate student is eligible to submit and present at EECScon! Although we originally targeted course 6 students, we'd love to have you present your research regardless of your major.
    </div>
     <div class = "faq-question">
      Can first year students submit abstracts?
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-answer ">
      YES! We strongly encourage any undergraduate student with research experience to apply to EECScon. Every year, we’ve had a number of first-year students present on their research. In fact, one year the oral presentation winner was a first-year student.
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-question">
      What should the abstract contain?
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-answer ">
      Abstracts must be no longer than 200 words and should introduce:
      <br />
      <ul>
        <li>the context of the work (including research question/problem) </li>
        <li> an outline of the solution's approach </li>
        <li> results/data (if any) </li>
      </ul> 
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-question">
      How does the review process work?
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-answer ">
      All submissions will automatically be considered for the poster session, and you will have the option to additionally be considered to give one of a few oral presentations. Accepted students will have the opportunity to be given help and feedback from graduate student mentors familiar with the research area.
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-question">
      Are there awards?
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-answer ">
      Yes, there are monetary awards! In past years, several top oral and poster presentations have won awards and prizes.
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-question">
      Not sure if you’re eligible or ready to submit? Other questions?
    </div>
    <div class = "faq-answer ">
      Drop us an <a href = "mailto:eecscon-chairs@mit.edu">email</a> at eecscon-chairs@mit.edu and we’ll be glad to talk it over!
